## Workshop Walk-through Documentation

You can view the workshop walk-through [here](http://18.236.74.213/index.html)

## Simple Installation

### Requirements

1. Delphix Engine >= 5.3.3 shared in your AWS account and region
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
(If you cannot use Docker Compose, then you can opt for the [Advanced Install](#advancedinstall))
3. AWS bucket with:
    1. [Datical License file](https://www.datical.com) named datical_admin.lic
    2. [DaticalDB-linux.gtk.x86_64-2019.2.2.6029.jar](https://www.datical.com)
    3. Oracle 12.2.0.1.0 -> [linuxx64_12201_database.zip](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/oracle12c-linux-12201-3608234.html)
    4. [oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)
    5. [oracle-instantclient12.2-tools-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)
    6. [oracle-instantclient12.2-jdbc-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)
    7. [oracle-instantclient12.2-sqlplus-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)
4. AWS access keys with permissions to read the s3 bucket from #3
5. AWS access keys to create and destroy EC2 objects (VPCs, subnets, SGs, ami's, instances, etc)
6. If executing from Windows, must use Linux Containers mode.

### Instructions

1. Download and extract the [latest release of this repo](https://github.com/delphix/dx-workshops/releases/latest)
2. Copy the .example.docker file to .docker.env and edit the variables to suit your environment (i.e. AWS keys and region) See #EnvironmentFile below
3. Open a terminal in the root of this repository
4. Build the demo AMI's in AWS via the Docker container (this process will take 45-60 minutes  
```docker-compose run tcw build```
5. Once the container completes, check for an ERROR.log or READY.log file. READY.log means the ami's were created successfully. ERROR.log means there was an issue. Please examine and resolve the issue and then start the process again. The build should resume from the last successful AMI.
6. Deploy the environment (this takes just a few minutes)  
```docker-compose run tcw deploy```
7. To get your environment information  
```docker-compose run tcw env```
8. The login username for the jumpbox is delphix, and the password is the value from the GUAC_USER_PASSWORD in your .docker.env
9. After the workshop is deployed, it can take 20-25 minutes for the environment automation to start and configure all of the components. There are two easy ways to check on the status of the workshop:
   1. Login to the jumpbox. When the file named WAIT on the desktop changes to READY, the workshop is ready to use. If the WAIT file changes to ERROR, something went wrong. This file is a log, you can open to inspect what happened.
   2. Use the built-in `ready` command. This command will tail the above log file and will return when the startup routine is correct.  
   ```docker-compose run tcw ready```
1.  When you are finished using your environment, teardown the environment  
```docker-compose run tcw destroy```
